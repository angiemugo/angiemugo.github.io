    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am a software developer with a passion for mobile development. My approach to product development is centered around the user. 
      I believe in creating highly customizable products to meet the diverse needs of users, especially those who require extensive accomodations. I pay close attention to accessibility, which is made easier by the integration of accessibility features in the native components we use. I am also cautious of dark patterns and believe in acquiring and retaining customers by providing genuine value, rather than making it difficult for them to leave the product.
